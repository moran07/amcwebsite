# Photography Portofolio Website

<a href="https://amcphotography.vercel.app/"><strong>âž¥ Live Demo</strong></a>

## Description

The porpuse of this website its to make it inmersive with the user.

My motivation is to make an interactive photography website, where you can hover over or click photos and it will follow and action that will give a pleasant visual result.

The reason I built a responsive website is to make it diferent for every type of screen, for example for laptops and pcs, photos will have animations, hover effects and transitions, while on ipads or tablets images response with different movements (X, Y), while on phones it will change saturation and border will change colors on some images.
